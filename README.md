# Programming-Fundamentals-1
          Introduction
This Team Project implements a book management system with the following final features:

It reads book information from a file and supports operations such as adding, viewing, modifying, deleting, partial searching, and calculating the total price of all books. 
The modified information is saved back to a specified file. Book information includes ISBN, book title, author, and price.When performing any of these functions, the system can verify whether the userâ€™s input is valid and prompt the user to re-enter if the input is invalid. 
Additionally, users can select the menu color and test some system functionalities using JUnit.

          Branch Model
          
Main: A stable version that can run properly.

Develop: Based on Version 4, additional features are implemented.
